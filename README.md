# python-design-patterns
A collection of design patterns in Python.

## Creational Design Patterns:

| Pattern | Description |
|:-------:| ----------- |
| [abstract_factory](src/abstract_factory/abstract_factory.py) | Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. |
| [builder](src/builder/builder.py) | Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations. |
| [factory_method](src/factory_method/factory_method.py) | Provide an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. |
| [prototype](src/prototype/prototype.py) | Specify the kinds of objects to create using a prototypical instance, and create new objects by copying this prototype. |
| [singleton](src/singleton/singleton.py) | Ensure a class on has only one instance and provide a global point of accessing to it. |
